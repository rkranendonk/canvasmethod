# Introduction

The Data Security Canvases help to identify the systems and data used in a business process, in a workshop-based approach, and then to classify this data and choose appropriate measures to secure the data in an efficient and effective manner.

The Data Security Canvases are part of the Canvas Method for Information Security. The Canvas Method for Data Security is a workshop-based approach, based on a process of learning to recognize the systems and data that are used. Specifically, the method helps to identify the data and, based on the classification of the data, formulate measures to secure the data in an efficient and effective manner.

For the classification of data, the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is used to assign standardized labels to the data. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a set of guidelines used to classify and share the sensitivity of information within a specific group or organization. TLP uses four colors: red, amber, green, and white, each indicating a different level of confidentiality. Red means that the information may only be shared with specific individuals within the organization; amber indicates that the information may be shared within a specific group; green means that the information may be shared within the organization; and white indicates that the information may be made public. The goal of TLP is to ensure that sensitive information is shared in a secure and controlled manner.

The result is a classification created by the team itself. This ensures ownership of the data and an understanding of why measures need to be taken.
