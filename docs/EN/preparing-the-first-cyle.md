# Preparation for the First Cycle

The following are determined with management:

- The goals of the ISMS
- The qualification of risk impact (high/medium/low) in terms of finances, reputational damage, and/or continuity
- The qualification of risk probability (high/medium/low) in terms of time/frequency
- The risk acceptance level
- The Teams (i.e., participants in the workshops) and Team Captains
- The length of a cycle/iteration (typically between 3 months and a year)
- Setting up incident registration (necessary for discussing incidents in the 3rd workshop)

The Workshop Facilitator gathers information about the organizationâ€™s context and the different teams, ensuring they have sufficient knowledge to achieve good results from the workshops.

Relevant topics may include:

- Applicable laws and regulations
- Implemented quality standards and compliance frameworks
- Organizational structure
- Primary processes
- Management processes
- Software and service providers in use
- Ongoing and planned changes and projects
- Existing security and privacy measures
