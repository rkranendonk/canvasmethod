# Preparing the Workshops

1. Compile/request the participant list (names, email addresses, and roles/functions, including preferred language if applicable)
2. Define the scope (if necessary, see below)
3. Facilities:
   * a room large enough to accommodate everyone and allow for some movement; preferably no static U-shaped setup
   * leave laptops at home!
   * a screen for presenting (USB-C, HDMI, or wireless casting)
4. Invite participants and provide preliminary information – an example invitation is provided below.

## Scope

It may happen that the workshop is organized for a group of participants from different parts of the organization, such as in a management session or a pilot. The participants' work environments, processes, and systems may differ. To keep the discussion and results meaningful, it helps to limit the scope to an organizational process that the majority of participants are involved in or familiar with, such as a customer journey or an employee journey.

## Example Invitation Email

> Dear Rein, Rybo, Pero, Tanvi, Tim, Sanneke, and Jan,
>
> 
> This Tuesday is the first of two workshops with the Canvas Method for Information Security.
>
> 
> In this session, we will interactively identify risks related to information security and compliance. These are risks that occur within your own workflows and in exchanges with others. Risks that are specific to your team/organization.
>
>
> What this workshop will deliver is an overview of the main risks, a shared understanding of the risks within each other's processes, and identifying who is best positioned to take action on a risk.
>
>
> In the second workshop, we will collectively determine what measures we can take to gradually improve the security of information processing.
>
> 
> In the first fifteen minutes of the workshop, I will further explain the methodology. You do not need to prepare anything.
>
> 
> A kind request from my side is not to bring laptops – I will take care of the note-taking.
> I look forward to doing this together with you, see you on Tuesday!
