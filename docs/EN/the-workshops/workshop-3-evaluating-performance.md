# Workshop 3: Evaluating performance



This workshop typically takes place 3 months after the second workshop (Identifying controls).

The Workshop Facilitator, possibly with the help of the Team Captain, prepares the session by:

* Selecting relevant incidents (from the incident register)
* Reviewing completed root cause analyses
* Examining previously established measures
* Analyzing results from effectiveness measurements

The following topics will be covered using the Canvas:

#### Incidents and Causes

The incidents from the past period will be discussed with the Team, and the cause of each incident will be determined.

#### Evaluation of Measures

For the measures that have been implemented, the effectiveness measurements will be discussed. Has the target been achieved, or does the measure need to be expanded or adjusted?

#### Improvements for the Next Iteration

Based on the incidents, causes, and evaluation of measures, it will be determined which improvements are necessary or desirable for the next iteration.

#### Outcomes

A report of the meeting and a list of improvements for the next iteration.

#### In-depth Information

The back of the Policy Card provides space for data on the effectiveness of the measures. The following are noted here:

* The result of the last effectiveness measurement
* By whom and when the measurement was performed
* Any reference to more detailed documentation
* The outcomes of the evaluation
* By whom the evaluation was performed
* Findings and recommendations from the Risk Owner.
