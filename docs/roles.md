# Roles

To properly and thoroughly implement the workshop, it is important that different disciplines come together to classify the data and identify measures from various perspectives. This ensures ownership and guarantees the technical feasibility of the measures. The composition of participants for the workshop is as follows:

* **Data Owner:** As the name suggests, this is the owner of the data used within the process. This is often a department head who is also considered the owner of the process. The data owner also becomes the owner of the classification of this data.
* **Subject Matter Specialist:** Persons who are substantively involved in the process and have in-depth knowledge of the data being analyzed.
* **CISO:** Responsible for information security.
* **Privacy Officer or Data Protection Officer:** Responsible for compliance with relevant laws and regulations and internal frameworks regarding personal data.
* **IT Manager or Administrator(s):** Responsible for implementing technical IT measures and advising on formulating measures.
* **Workshop Facilitator:** Directs the progress of the workshop itself. Is not substantively involved in the decisions made. Must have knowledge in the field of data security and compliance.
