# Preparation

* Drawing up/requesting the list of participants (names, email addresses, and roles/functions, possibly working language)
* Printing Canvas, gathering Post-its and markers.
* Determining the scope (if necessary, see below)
* Facilities:
  * A space where we fit and can move around a bit. Preferably no static U-shaped setup.
  * Laptops can stay at home!
  * A screen to display a presentation (USB-C, HDMI, or wireless casting).
* Inviting participants and providing preliminary information â€“ an example of an invitation is included below.

### Scope

It is important to have a clear scope for the workshop to ensure its effectiveness. It helps to keep the number of participants limited to a maximum of ten. In addition, it must be determined in advance which process will be analyzed and what the scope of the workshop is. Besides processes, this method can also be applied at department level if the size of the organization allows it.
