## The Canvas Method for Risk Management

The Canvas Method is a workshop-based risk management method to engage stakeholders in risk identification and risk reduction, across organisational boundaries. It is lightweight, communicative and actionable and creates involvement in business teams, by focussing on recognizable risks in their own workflows.

The Canvas Method identifies previously unknown risks in business processes, and raises the maturity level of risk management.

The Canvas Method is compatible with the High Level Structure (HLS) of ISO standards, and as such has many successful application domains, like information security, food safety and social sustainability.

Here's a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy-yQ2UbSzA) highlighting the use of the Canvases in the domain of information security.
